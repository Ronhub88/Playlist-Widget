This is a basic framework for a widget that will display the last 5 songs in an XML playlist accessible by HTTP.  By itself it wont work, you need to configure it to connect to your service.  

Additionally, this widget is configured to use Google Analytics to see how the widget gets used. You will need to provide an Analytics ID (in the form of UA-000000-00) for this to work.

Compiling
